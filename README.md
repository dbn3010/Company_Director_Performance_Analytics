# Company_Director_Performance_Analytics
This repository includes Tableau Dashboard presentation about the performance statistics of Board Members across companies acquired from FreeFloatMedia as part of  Capstone project deliverables

The final dashboard is prepared to include three main aspects of the project as per our understandings. These are overall diversity, influence factors and performance of the board members. Hence, on each of the story boards we have tried to present these aspects in terms of overall statistics, company-wise statistics, and individual statistics. This is an interactive dashboard that will take input from the user to select the company or director name and present their corresponding stats accordingly.

The project deliverables are:
